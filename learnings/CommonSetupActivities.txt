# Readme.txt
# This file contains various entitities that explains how the Compute instances were setup
# How the RDP was installed
# How the connection was created with git from remote
# First how to ensure that the Ubuntu that you are running is also able to do the RDP

2  sudo apt-get update
3  sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install xfce4
4  sudo apt install xfce4-session
5  sudo apt-get -y install xrdp
6  sudo systemctl enable xrdp
7  echo xfce4-session >~/.xsession
8  sudo service xrdp restart
9  sudo passwd azureuser

# Make sure that the RDP port is enabled in the NSG in Azure, Test that the connection is working from Azure portal and then download the RDP file 
# to connect. 

# Install Chrome on the machine once done
# You'll remember to start the xrdp session everytime you boot the machine if the RDP session is not working. 

# Installing Google Chrome
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

# Next copy this file to the newly created folder. 

# If you need to find out how to add new SSH key, see the following
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh
#If you want to and might need to, its better to create a personal access token

# So what commands are needed to create the git repository from command line
# move to the folder where you've added some of the files
# you've added this Readme.txt file

# to setup the git user and email, use the following commands
git config --global --edit
